<p>My research focuses on <strong>artificial intelligence applied to biology and medicine</strong>. I am particularly interested in <strong> data integration</strong>, i.e. in developing models by harvesting heterogeneous data from genomics, proteomics, medical literature, ontologies, and knowledgebases. I coordinated multi-disciplinary, international research teams comprising medical doctors, biologists, and engineers, across 8 institutions in Europe, Asia, and North America.</p>

<p>Regarding my Italian name, I understand it does not sound familiar to non-native Italian speakers. That's fine, you can call me with the English "Simon", or <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LZ6Xqnn_AnY">properly pronounce my Italian name</a>.
<br /><font size="1">Just please please please do not call me with the Spanish "Sim√≥n".</font></p>
